## So What is Backtesting?

Backtesting is the research process of applying a trading strategy idea to historical data in order to ascertain past performance. In particular, a backtester makes no guarantee about the future performance of the strategy. They are however an essential component of the strategy pipeline research process, allowing strategies to be filtered out before being placed into production.

## The Meat and Potatoes

### **Packages**

**_Jupyter_**: the meta research and analysis notebook system

**_NumPy_**: the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
- an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. 
- arbitrary data-types can be defined. 
    - allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

**_Matplotlib_**: Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

- generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.
- Can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPythonshells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

**_Pandas_**: provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive

- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure



### **Libraries**

**_SciPy_**: provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.

**_SymPy_**: for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

### **Modules**

**_Collections_**: Provides the deque() method for rapid ques (showing whats running in backtest)

**_Decimal_**: this class is especially helpful for

- financial applications and other uses which require exact decimal representation
- control over precision,
- control over rounding to meet legal or regulatory requirements,
- tracking of significant decimal places, or
- applications where the user expects the results to match calculations done by hand.

**_Logging_**: full featured and flexible logging system.

**_Pprint_**: offers more sophisticated control over printing both built-in and user defined objects in a way that is readable by the interpreter.

**_Textwrap_**: formats paragraphs of text to fit a given screen width.
